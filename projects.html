					<ul>
						<li><a href="">Voicenet</a></li>
						<p>Voicenet is a comprehensive python library for performing speech/voice based functions. It is capable of doing:
							<ul>
								<li>Speech to text (STT)
											<li>Gender detection based on the voice.
													<li>Pronunciation posterior score
															<li>Articulation-rate
																	<li>Speech rate
																			<li>Filler words
																					<li>Age detection from voice.
																							<li>Emotion detection from voice.
						</ul></p>

						<li><a href="">Product Visualisation using Deep Learning</a></li>
						<p>This is for automatic catalogue tagging for e-commerce, it has multiple features like contextual image understanding, it can relate semantic query with catalogue to show the optimal products from the catalogue.</p>
						<p>There are 5 modules in this project as follows:
							<ul>
							<li>A category like jeans tops, shirts based classification of cloths.
								<li>Color-based classification.
									<li>Deep similarity model for finding similar products. 
										<li>Pattern and cloth wear type based context-based search.
											<li>Cloth fit type based predictions.
												All models are implemented with SVM, Logistic Classifier, CNN-1, and CNN-2, This project yield a research paper soon in Sci-Journal.
							</ul>
						</p>
						<li><a href="">Amazon Product Reviews Sentiment Analysis</a></li>
						<p>It’s a Sentiment analysis projects which is a binary classification of amazon product reviews. There are thousands of reviews, to get an average review of a product i have implemented this model, it basically classifies review into positive or negative, we have used keyword-based, TF-IDF based, and similarity-based approaches to solving this problem.
We have used Graphlab library by Apple Inc. for this project.
</p>
						<li><a href="">Stock Price Prediction using LSTMN</a></li>
						<p>This is a project for stock price prediction using RNN and LSTMN, we have taken data from Yahoo finance for 5 years for S&P 500 companies, and run LSTMNN model for prediction, as of now the error is 4.4%.</p>
						<li><a href="">Pneumonia detection from X-ray using Deep Learning</a></li>
						<p>This is deep learning(CNN) based pneumonia detection from x-ray, according to medical reports doctors can detect pneumonia in only 76% cases which causes the death of millions of people worldwide due to pneumonia especially in African countries. Our system has achieved an accuracy of 82% till now and we are fine-tuning our model.</p>
						<li><a href="">House Price Prediction using Regression </a></li>
						<p>House price prediction is a regression-based problem in which we have calculated the price of a house based on various parameters such as area, no. of bedrooms, etc total 47, it is a multivariate regression problem, in which we have also done L1 and L2 that means lasso and ridge regression for preventing overfitting and more generalization.</p>
						<li><a href="">Fruit Classification Problem(74 class classification problem)</a></li>
						<p>This is a  multiclass image classification project in which i worked on 74 class classifier, i have used transfer learning approach from Imagenet and Alexnet models in our classification problem, it’s an inter and intra class classification problem.</p>
						<li><a href="">Emotion understanding from text using RNN/LSTM</a></li>
						<p>For chat-based applications, if we can better understand the emotions of the user we can enhance the experience because most of the chatbots available today do conversation in a neutral tone that is very weird and looks kind of robotic. To make the experience more like human, blend of EI and AI can improve things on a scale.  </p>
						<li><a href="">Sign Language detection from live video/images using CNN.</a></li>
						<p>Sign language understanding for people who can not speak they can use sign language in front of the camera it coverts signs into text followed by text to speech so that they can communicate with ease.</p>
						<li><a href="">Style transfer in images using GANs</a></li>
						<p>Image style transfer using GANs. we can put the style of one image over other. Like sea style over a random click or oil painting style or mountain style, anything which we can think. 
								This technology has very good applications in terms of image generation and has wide use cases like generate designs for, AI designer, no need to hire designers to design clothes.
								</p>
						<li><a href="">SchoolERP (in MVC Codeigniter)</a></li>
						<p>SchoolERP provides a suite of software covering all parts of a schools' administration, managing registration and admissions, from behaviour and achievement [As part of CCE in Examination module], managing Library, Fee, Accounts, Front - Office, Inventory, Time Table, Infirmary, Hostel & Mess, HR & Payroll and Transport .
								Complete application is created in such a manner that at almost all possible places, you may play with records in your style, you may create master records as per your need.
								Application is ready to be integrated with any third party device, viz. Biometric Attendance Machine, Barcode Scanner etc.
								</p>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/Akshat4112/SWQMS">Sea water quality monitoring system</a></li>
						<p>Sea Water Quality Monitoring System is a web based application in which people can upload data from various Labs,upload excel files in predefined format and based on certain algorithms all the reports are checked and showing danger in areas,cluster based Maps,Demographics,Alerts,Location Overview and much more.
							</p>
						<li><a href="">Chatbots (for Industry-specific tasks)</a></li>
						<p>In Banking, banking chatbot for general queries like account balance, opening a new account, know about schemes of bank, FD rates and general bank queries, implemented using IBM Watson.</p>
						<p>Similairily, in Human Resource, and other domains.</p>
